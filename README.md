# quadratic-sorts
Three very popular quadratic algorithms are Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort and three linearithmic Heapsort, Merge sort and Quicksort. Quicksort has a Quadratic worst case, but since it is often implemented in ways that make that very unlikely it deserves the linearithmic category.
